Its main results and conclusions are:• Explicit attention to characteristics of software quality can lead to significant savings in software life-cycle costs.• The current software state-of-the-art imposes specific limitations on our ability to automatically and quantitatively evaluate the quality of software.• A definitive hierarchy of well-defined, well-differentiated characteristics of software quality is developed. Its higher-level structure reflects the actual uses to which software quality evaluation would be put; its lower-level characteristics are closely correlated with actual software metric evaluations which can be performed.• A large number of software quality-evaluation metrics have been defined, classified, and evaluated with respect to their potential benefits, quantifiability, and ease of automation.•Particular software life-cycle activities have been identified which have significant leverage on software quality.Most importantly, we believe that the study reported in this paper provides for the first time a clear, well-defined framework for assessing the often slippery issues associated with software quality, via the consistent and mutually supportive sets of definitions, distinctions, guidelines, and experiences cited. This framework is certainly not complete, but it has been brought to a point sufficient to serve as a viable basis for future refinements and extensions.},

  abstract  = {Product quality is determined by the internal factors of the artifacts generated during the analysis, design and implementation stages. Assessing quality based on existing models is not a trivial process. Several development approaches exist (i.e., structured, object-oriented, component-based, and web-based) which involve different kinds of artifacts susceptible of being measured when estimating the product's internal quality. Such internal attributes affect the product's external quality expressed as external characteristics and subcharacteristics. This work aims to specify internal quality considering the approach used to develop the product. For the preparation of this proposal, we identified several artifacts associated to each approach to define internal quality metrics and their impact on the product's external quality. We analyzed the principles inherent to each approach and the artifacts included in their methods. The GQM approach was applied to propose measurements and metrics determining artifacts quality and its relation with ISO/IEC 9126 characteristics and subcharacteristics. The result was a model that gathers the main quality aspects into the six ISO characteristics, and including 298 metrics adapted to these approaches. For reviewing purposes, our new model was applied to four case studies associated to each development approach.},
