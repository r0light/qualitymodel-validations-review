And a quality model specific to use case to be able to define specific, measurable requirements. A main argument is that is is impossible to define a generally applicable quality model and quality models with requirements should be specific to a use case. Stated impacts between internal properties and quality attributes can only be validated through external measurements.                                                                                                                                                                       |

The latest paper presents a quality model for web services monitoring tools. The quality model is built using the ISO 9126 standard and logical deduction of suitable quality attributes and metrics. Because it evaluates monitoring tools according to their functionalitites, it considers only external characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
