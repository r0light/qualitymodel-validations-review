# Quality Model Validation Approaches

This is the accompanying repository to the paper "A Review of Approaches for Quality Model Validations in the Context of Cloud-native Applications" submitted to [ZEUS2022](https://zeus2022.pi.uni-bamberg.de/). It contains the data used in the paper (that means the literature used and its classifications). The list of entries used for the results & implications section can be viewed here: [https://r0light.github.io/qualitymodel-validations-review/](https://r0light.github.io/qualitymodel-validations-review/)

[initial-set.md](initial-set.md) shows the initially collected literature from the reviews on quality models with the classification of *Contribution type*,*Characteristics considered*, and *Rationale for non-trivial relationships*.

[final-set.md](final-set.md) shows the filtered set of literature (only literature contributing a *model* or a *validation-method* considering *internal characteristics*) and the literature found through forward search. This set of literature is used to describe the results in the paper and derive implications. In addition the literature here is classified according to *ExplicitValidation* and *ValidatedRelations*

In [r-analysis](r-analysis) the details for the filtering and quantitative analysis can be found (for which [R](https://r-project.org/) was used.)

Finally, in [literature.bib](literature.bib) bibliographic details for the used literature can be found.
