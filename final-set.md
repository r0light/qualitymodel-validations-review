By calculating the correlation coefficients, the authors can decide which characteristics correlate with quality in use and which not. Overall they found all quality subcharacteristics to correlate with quality in use except for security. Th quality characteristics they consider stem from the ISO 9126 standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                     |yes               |UserMeasure-DeploymentMeasure                                                                                                         |

Instead, the method for how to use the model is presented and several use cases are discussed. For the aggregation of measures along the quality attribute hierarchy a normalization and averaging approach is taken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                     |no                |                                                                                                                                      |

To create the quality model, they did interviews with experts and in addition performed a literature survey to identify characteristics important for quality. Through the interviews also the relationships between code characteristics and quality attributes, especially their relative importance became clear. In addition the authors also performed a survey where developers were asked to rate the importance of different characteristics to certain quality attributes based on a Likert-Scale. For the survey agreement was measured using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance W and correlation between participants was measured using Kendall’s τ as well as the parametric Spearman’s ρ. Using a twofold threshold that 1. the median must be a certain value and 2. that 75% of respondents must be at least a certain value, relationship were considered validated if these thresholds were met.|                                     |yes               |QualityAspectValidity,ProductFactor-QualityAspect,ProductFactorImpactWeights                                                          |

Its maintainability metrics are applied to a range of open source Java programs and the results are compared to those of a previous study focusing on ISO 9126 in order to evaluate the suitability of the CISQ specification. The evaluation is therefore only based on the end results of the quality evaluation.
